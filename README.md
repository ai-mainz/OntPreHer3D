# OntPreHer3D

**Ontology for the Preservation of Cultural Heritage 3D Models**

OntPreHer3D is an ontology designed to support the documentation, analysis, and publication of 3D digital reconstructions of lost or never-built architectural heritage. It enables structured and semantically rich descriptions of 3D models, their sources, interpretation processes, and preservation context.

## 🔗 Compatibility

OntPreHer3D builds upon and aligns with the following established ontologies:

- [CIDOC CRM 7.1.3](http://www.cidoc-crm.org/cidoc-crm/)
- [CRMdig 4.0](http://www.cidoc-crm.org/extensions/crmdig/)
- [CRMinf 1.0](http://www.cidoc-crm.org/extensions/crminf/)
- [LRMoo 0.9.6](http://iflastandards.info/ns/lrm/lrmoo/)
- [OntSciDoc3D 2.0](https://www.ontscidoc3d.hs-mainz.de/ontology/)

---

## 🧠 Purpose

This ontology was developed by **Igor Bajena** as part of a PhD dissertation focused on the documentation and publication of **hypothetical digital 3D reconstructions** of lost or never-built architectural heritage.

It provides:
- A semantic framework for tracing the origins, uncertainties, and sources of 3D reconstructions
- Structures to support transparency and reproducibility in 3D digital heritage workflows

## 🇪🇺 EU Funding Acknowledgment

It also served as a base for semantic repository of hypothetical 3D reconstruction models within the scope of the [**CoVHer – Computer-based Visualization of Architectural Cultural Heritage**](https://covher.eu/) project, funded by the **European Commission** under the **Erasmus+ programme, Key Action 2 (KA2) – Capacity Building in the Field of Higher Education**. The classes and properties developed in OntPreHer3D are aligned with the [CoVHer Glossary](https://covher.eu/glossary/), which reflects a shared conceptual foundation developed by partners of the CoVHer project from:

- 🇮🇹 **University of Bologna** (Italy)
- 🇩🇪 **Hochschule Mainz – University of Applied Sciences**  
  & **Interessengemeinschaft für Semantische Datenverarbeitung e.V.** (Germany)
- 🇵🇱 **Warsaw University of Technology** (Poland)
- 🇪🇸 **Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona**  
  & **La Tempesta: City, Culture & Technology** (Spain)
- 🇵🇹 **Faculdade de Arquitectura, Universidade do Porto** (Portugal)

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

Development was supported by **Mark Fichtner**, **Peggy Große**, and **Robert Nasarek**, who each contributed in distinct ways:

- **Mark Fichtner** provided technical guidance and support regarding Linked Open Data principles and helped establish a solid foundation for working with semantic technologies.
- **Peggy Große** acted as a mentor throughout the ontology development process, offering continuous conceptual feedback and thorough revisions of the ontology structure.
- **Robert Nasarek**, along with the [**WissKI Community**](https://wiss-ki.eu/), assisted in resolving technical issues related to the implementation and integration of the ontology.
