Compatibale with:
ECRM 240307/CIDOC CRM 7.1.3. (http://erlangen-crm.org/240307/ / http://www.cidoc-crm.org/cidoc-crm/)

The ontology was developed by Igor Bajena as part of his PhD dissertation about the documentation and publication of hypothetical digital 3D reconstructions of lost or never-built architectural heritage. 

This implementation was created in collaboration with partners of an EU-funded project of Computer-based Visualization of Architectural Cultural Heritage (CoVHer, https://covher.eu/) from Italy (University of Bologna), Germany (Hochschule Mainz-University of Applied Sciences & Interessengemeinschaft für Semantische Datenverarbeitung e.V.), Poland (Warsaw University of Technology), Spain (Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona & La Tempesta: City, culture & technology) and Portugal (Faculdade de Arquitectura Universidade do Porto). The development process was supported by Mark Fichtner, Peggy Große, and Robert Nasarek.
